The official website for the television anime of Rifujin na Magonote's Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation light novel series began streaming the second promotional video for the show's sequel (its second cours or second quarter of a year) on Monday. The video teases the characters that will appear in the second part, and it also previews the new theme song "Keishō no Uta" (Song of Succession) by returning singer Yuiko Ōhara.
The second cours will premiere on October 3 and will air in Japan on Tokyo MX, KBS Kyoto, and BS11. The main cast will appear in a television special one week before on September 26.
Funimation will stream the second part of the anime this fall. The show's staff had delayed the anime from July to October due to "various circumstances."

The first anime premiered on the Tokyo MX, KBS Kyoto, and BS11 channels on January 10. Funimation streamed the series in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico, and Brazil. The company describes the anime:

The story follows a 34-year-old man who is killed after trying to save someone from getting hit by a car. He soon finds himself reincarnated in a magical world as Rudeus Greyrat, except that he gets his whole life reset, starting as a baby.
With all of his knowledge from his previous life, and a new heaping helping of magical ability, Rudeus quickly becomes a formidable warrior ready for adventure. Oh, and he's still a total pervert.

Manabu Okamoto (Gamers!) is directing the series at Studio Bind. EGG FIRM is also credited for production. Kazutaka Sugiyama (animation director for DARLING in the FRANXX) is designing the characters. Yuiko Ōhara produced, wrote, scored, and sang both the opening theme song and the ending theme song for the first half of the series.

Seven Seas Entertainment has licensed both the light novel series and Yuka Fujikawa's manga adaptation. The company has also licensed Shōko Iwami's Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Gets Serious (Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Datte Honki desu) spinoff manga.

The television anime of Koharu Inoue's The Duke of Death and His Maid (Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid) manga ended on Sunday with an special commercial announcing that a sequel has been green-lit.
The manga's story centers on the titular Duke of Death, cursed to steal the life from any living thing that he touches. He is accompanied by his maid Alice, who enjoys teasing him, but is the only remaining person devoted to him.

Yoshiki Yamakawa (Kill Me Baby, Little Busters!, Hi Score Girl) directed the first anime at J.C. Staff. Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment was in charge of the CGI. Hideki Shirane (Date A Live, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) was in charge of the series scripts. Michiru Kuwabata (Danchi Tomoo, Hi Score Girl) drew the character designs. Yusuke Suzuki was the CG director. Gen Okuda and Takeshi Watanabe composed the music.

Inoue launched the manga in Shogakukan's Sunday Webry web manga site in October 2017. Seven Seas Entertainment is releasing the manga in English.
Update: Funimation, which is streaming the anime with an English dub and with English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles, describes the sequel as a second season.

In the year 2022, gamers rejoice as Sword Art Online—a VRMMORPG (virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game) like no other—debuts, allowing players to take full advantage of the ultimate in gaming technology: NerveGear, a system that allows users to completely immerse themselves in a wholly realistic gaming experience. But when the game goes live, the elation of the players quickly turns to horror as they discover that, for all its amazing features, SAO is missing one of the most basic functions of any MMORPG: a logout button. Now trapped in the virtual world of Aincrad, their bodies held captive by NerveGear in the real world, users are issued a chilling ultimatum: conquer all 100 floors of Aincrad to regain your freedom. But in the warped world of SAO, "game over" means certain death—both virtual and real....
	
It's really cool to see a light novel audiobook read by the protagonist's English dub actor. Light novel audiobooks are rare to begin with, but there's an even greater feeling of immersion than usual when you're already familiar with the character's voice. If you're a Sword Art Online and a dub fan, you probably don't need me to tell you to try this out, but for those of you on the fence, there are two things in particular I want to highlight in this review: Bryce Papenbrook's performance and whether the story of SAO's first volume still holds up today.

Let's start with the audio side. I'm not normally the kind of person who listens to audiobooks, but I had no complaints on the technical front. Any modest expectations I had were exceeded by the delivery; listening to Bryce Papenbrook in audiobook form gave me new appreciation for his range as an actor. Because he's often typecast as the "angsty teen protagonist," it was refreshing to hear him tackle the voices of all the various side characters in SAO's first volume, of which there are surprisingly many.

Still, this is a book that's told mostly inside Kirito's head, and Papenbrook displays admirable skill in narrating prose that could easily have become tedious. Kirito's vulnerabilities and thoughtfulness come across even when he is explaining game minutiae. What might be even more impressive is how Papenbrook sells the emotional impact of lines that would otherwise come across as unbearably corny. There are quite a lot of love scenes between Kirito and Asuna—perhaps too many for the book's good—but Papenbrook handles each and every one of them with aplomb.

As the above paragraph implies, Sword Art Online's first volume is a distinctly uneven experience. It was Reki Kawahara's first ever attempt at writing a novel, and one can easily see the telltale signs of a book that crams in too many subplots for its own good. In the years since, many aspects of this first novel have been fleshed out significantly – like Kirito's tragic history with Sachi and the fateful raid against the murderous Laughing Coffin guild – but here, those backstories are abridged to the point where they have very little narrative weight. It's also notable that the book has an abrupt time skip after its tension-filled opening, and a meandering second act.

But Sword Art Online still gets the important things right. Its premise may be a familiar one by now, but the opening chapters are effective at instilling an inevitable feeling of dread. The book also has an impressively action-packed and emotional climax. Even in the earliest stages of his career, Kawahara has had a keen knack for action scenes; unlike many of his contemporaries, he knew how to modulate the density of his descriptions in order to portray a sense of immediacy. The result is a book that is as thrilling as it is rich with detail about its virtual world.

Papenbrook's acting has great synergy with Kawahara's dramatic writing, especially in the latter end of the book. When the pace picks up, so does the speed of Papenbrook's narration; when the emotional climax arrives, he slows down and softens his voice while maintaining a breathless sense of anticipation. I also have to give my kudos to the English translator Stephen Paul; it takes a confident translator to write prose that sounds perfectly natural when spoken aloud. The fact that this was an audiobook experience with no wrinkles is as much a compliment to the translator as it is to the actor.

All in all, I had a great time with this audiobook, and it was a nice opportunity to revisit Sword Art Online, warts and all. For all its obvious flaws, the story still holds up pretty well as an entertaining action novel even to this day. As a side note about the audiobook version, I think it helped with the immersion that this volume had a mostly male side cast. While I think that Papenbrook's take on Asuna was fine as a contrast to Kirito's voice, I can foresee some difficulties in the future as SAO's female cast expands. But that's all a story for another day—this audiobook gets a solid recommendation from me.

The 100th issue of Kill Time Communication's Comic Valkyrie digital manga magazine announced on Wednesday that writer Dall-Young Lim and artist Kwang-Hyun Kim will launch a new manga in the magazine's next issue in early October. The manga will center on a genius manga creator who uses their drawing skills when they are reincarnated into another world to become unmatched in the new world.

Lim and Kim launched the Ponkotsu Megami no Isekai Sōseiroku manga (pictured at right) in Comic Valkyrie in April 2019. The manga's sixth and final volume will ship on October 8. The manga follows a "has-been goddess" who creates an alternate world. The authors put their Freezing manga on hiatus at the same time that they launched Ponkotsu Megami no Isekai Sōseiroku.

Lim and Kim launched Freezing in Kill Time Communication's Comic Valkyrie magazine in 2007, and transferred it to the digital version after Comic Valkyrie ceased print publication in 2012. Kill Time Communication published the manga's 33rd volume in November 2018. The manga has inspired several spinoff series, and the third spinoff, Freezing Pair Love Stories, launched in 2013. Seven Seas Entertainment publishes the main manga in North America in two-in-one omnibus collections.

Funimation streamed the manga's 12-episode anime series adaptation as it aired in 2011, as well as the Freezing Vibration second season. The company released both series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.

Lim and Kim's Black God manga was adapted into a television anime titled Kurokami The Animation, which premiered with a simulcast dub in 2008. Yen Press published all 19 volumes of the Black God manga.




IBM’s new POWER9 processor

AI workloads are different from the calculations most of our current computers are built to perform. AI implies prediction, inference, intuition. But the most creative machine learning algorithms are hamstrung by machines that can’t harness their power. Hence, if we’re to make great strides in AI, our hardware must change, too. Starting with GPUs, and then evolving to analog devices, and then fault tolerant quantum computers.

Let’s start in the present, with applying massively distributed deep learning algorithms to Graphics processing units (GPU) for high speed data movement, to ultimately understand images and sound. The DDL algorithms “train” on visual and audio data, and the more GPUs should mean faster learning. To date, IBM’s record-setting 95 percent scaling efficiency (meaning improved training as more GPUs are added) can recognize 33.8 percent of 7.5 million images, using 256 GPUs on 64 “Minsky” Power systems.

IBM Unveils Industry’s Most Advanced Server Designed for Artificial Intelligence: POWER9 processor designed for AI workloads

Distributed deep learning has progressed at a rate of about 2.5 times per year since 2009, when GPUs went from video game graphics accelerators to deep learning model trainers. So a question I addressed at Applied Materials’ Semiconductor Futurescapes: New Technologies, New Solutions event during the 2017 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting:

What technology do we need to develop in order to continue this rate of progress and go beyond the GPU?

Beyond GPUs
We at IBM Research believe that this transition from GPUs will happen in three stages. First, we’ll utilize GPUs and build new accelerators with conventional CMOS in the near term to continue; second, we’ll look for ways to exploit low precision and analog devices to further lower power and improve performance; and then as we enter the quantum computing era, it will potentially offer entirely new approaches.

AI
AI systems are tolerant of errors in ML models because they can be averaged out. It knows Mona Lisa even with missing pixels.

Accelerators on CMOS still have much to achieve because machine learning models can tolerate imprecise computation. It’s precisely because they “learn” that these models can work through errors (errors we would never tolerate in a bank transaction). In 2015, Suyog Gupta, et al. demonstrated in their ICML paper Deep learning with limited numerical precision that in fact reduced-precision models have equivalent accuracy to today’s standard 64 bit, but using as few as 14 bits of floating point precision. We see this reduced precision, faster computation trend contributing to the 2.5X-per-year improvement at least through the year 2022.

That gives us about five years to get beyond the von Neumann bottleneck, and to analog devices. Moving data to and from memory slows down deep learning network training. So finding analog devices that can combine memory and computation will be important for neuromorphic computing progress.

Neuromorphic computing, as it sounds, mimics brain cells. Its architecture of interconnected “neurons” replace von-Neumann’s back-and-forth bottleneck with low-powered signals that go directly between neurons for more efficient computation. The US Air Force Research Lab is testing a 64-chip array of our IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System designed for deep neural-network inferencing and information discovery. The system uses standard digital CMOS but only consumes 10 watts of energy to power its 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses.

But phase change memory, a next-gen memory material, may be the first analog device optimized for deep learning networks. How does a memory – the very bottleneck of von-Neumann architecture – improve machine learning? Because we’ve figured out how to bring computation to the memory. Recently, IBM scientists demonstrated in-memory computing with 1 million devices for applications in AI, publishing their results, Temporal correlation detection using computational phase-change memory, in Nature Communications, and also presenting it at the IEDM session Compressed Sensing Recovery using Computational Memory.

Analog computing’s maturity will extend the 2.5X-per-year machine learning improvement for a few more years, to 2026 or thereabout…

…And into the era of quantum
While currently utilizing just a few qubits, algorithms run on the free and open IBM Q experience systems are already showing the potential for efficient and effective use in chemistry, optimization, and even machine learning. A paper IBM researchers co-authored with scientists from Raytheon BBN, “Demonstration of quantum advantage in machine learning” in Nature Quantum Information demonstrates how, with only a five superconducting quantum bit processor, the quantum algorithm consistently identified the sequence in up to a 100-fold fewer computational steps and was more tolerant of noise than the classical (non-quantum) algorithm.

IBM Q’s commercial systems now have 20 qubits, and a prototype 50 qubit device is operational. Its average coherence time of 90µs is also double that of previous systems. But a fault tolerant system that shows a distinct quantum advantage over today’s machines is still a work in progress. In the meantime, experimenting with new materials (like the replacement of copper interconnects) is key – as are other crucial chip improvements IBM and its partners presented at IEDM in the name of advancing all computing platforms, from von Neumann, to neuromorphic, and quantum.


NVIDIA reusing higher-end GPUs for lower SKUs is not exactly a new topic. Once the company accumulates a large stock of dies that cannot be sold as any other model, the decision is made to supply those chips to AIBs, who then sell them directly to customers, often not even mentioning it has a different GPU.

An appearance of the GA104-based RTX 3060 model has been discovered by @T4CFantasy, the maintainer of TechPowerUP’s GPU database. According to him, this new model has a device ID of 2487.

Historically speaking, GX104 and 106 GPUs often share the same pin layout, which makes the transition process for AIBs seamless. There are, however, often small variances when it comes to TDP. For this reason, NVIDIA is not allowing GX104 GPUs to be sold ’60 series’ anywhere else but China, where consumer laws aren’t as strong as in Europe or North America where the product needs to be exactly as described.

The RTX 3060 with GA104 GPU would feature 3584 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit interface. This would, in fact, be the first GA104 GPU with more than 8GB of memory. What this also means is that nearly 42% of the full chip is disabled, which is a lot more than 7% on the ‘original’ RTX 3060.

The card with the lowest count of CUDA cores officially shipping with GA104 GPU is a mobile RTX A3000 graphics card with 4096 CUDAs. In other words, anything that has fewer cores is simply of no use to NVIDIA. A question arises though, what are NVIDIA plans in regard to RTX 3060 SUPER. The last-gen RTX 2060 SUPER featured TU104 GPU whereas the non-SUPER was TU106 based. With the Ampere series though, NVIDIA still has 7% of GA106 GPU to use for the higher-end model.

Elder Scrolls Online which debuted in 2014 does not require a very powerful GPU. This is a massive online multiplayer that can successfully be played at high settings and resolution with upper mid-range GPUs. The graphics cards such as RTX 3080 can easily run the game at 4K with 120+ FPS. This is why some users may not want to enable upscaling technology, which by principle renders the game at lower resolution.

This is where ESO developers came up with the idea of adopting NVIDIA DLSS but without an upscaling component. This essentially means running DLSS at native resolution and claiming the benefits of smooth edges thanks to AI-powered antialiasing technology.

Alex Tardif, who is a Lead Graphics Engineer at ZeniMax Online Studios, says that DLAA may require more power and thus not be as fast as Temporal AntiAliasing (TAA), but the end result is better.

What was not stated though is whether DLAA works on non-RTX cards, which lack Tensor core acceleration. Otherwise, this technology would only serve as an image quality improvement, not as a performance booster.


Leipzig, Germany, September 16th 2021 – With the 15.6 and 17.3 inch XMG APEX gaming laptops, XMG is positioning a new model series below its own high-end range consisting of the NEO and PRO series. These new laptops combine mobile AMD eight-core processors up to the Ryzen 9 5900HX with NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards up to the RTX 3070. The company is simultaneously introducing the XMG FOCUS, a new product series in the entry-level segment. Intel’s Core i7-11800H and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti offer decent gaming performance, while good connectivity and memory round off the overall package. All four new models feature an IPS display with 144 Hz.


Until now, the XMG APEX 15 in the older E20 generation represented uncompromising desktop CPU performance, with processors up to the Ryzen 9 3950X in a laptop. Although XMG is already working on a direct successor under a slightly different name, it is unleashing the XMG APEX 15 and APEX 17 of the M21 generation for the time being with the currently fastest eight-core mobile processors from AMD. The laptops are available with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H as well as with the slightly faster Ryzen 9 5900HX from the 54 watt TDP class, as well as with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or RTX 3060 in the respective maximum TGP configuration (RTX 3070: 125 watts plus 15 watts Dynamic Boost 2.0; RTX 3060: 115 watts plus 15 watts Dynamic Boost 2.0).

Visually, the newcomers are characterised by an extroverted aesthetic, as evidenced by the confident design of the display lid, which in the case of the 15.6 inch model is crafted from aluminium, and the large air vents in the chassis. At 361 x 258 x 29 mm and 2.2 kg (APEX 15) and 396 x 262 x 32.4 mm and 2.5 kg (APEX 17), both models are comparatively robust. The laptops each integrate a viewing-angle-stable 144 Hz IPS display with Full HD resolution, a brightness of 300 nits and 90 percent sRGB colour space coverage, as well as a 49 Wh plug-in and thus exchangeable battery. In line with XMG’s standard, there are two slots for up to 64 GB of socket-mounted instead of soldered DDR4-3200 RAM. For fast NVMe SSDs, APEX offers two M.2 slots with a PCI Express connection via four lanes each; due to the AMD mobile platform, this is PCIe 3.0.

Multi-monitor users or VR headset owners will find three external graphics interfaces, all of which are directly connected to the NVIDIA GPU. In addition to a Mini DisplayPort and HDMI output, the XMG APEX also offers DisplayPort via USB-C. The video interfaces are located on the back of the laptops, as is the 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port. There are also three USB-A slots, a headset-compatible 2-in-1 audio jack, a separate microphone input and fast Wi-Fi 6. Both laptops feature a full-size keyboard with full numpad and multicolour backlighting (15 colours) as well as a Microsoft Precision-compliant touchpad.

While the CORE laptops with an RTX 3060 have so far been the entry point to XMG’s current 15.6- and 17.3 inch portfolio, the German-based company is now extending its lineup with a new model series, the FOCUS 15 and FOCUS 17 (M21). Just like the Intel-based versions of the CORE and NEO series, the FOCUS makes no compromises in terms of processor performance, offering the Core i7-11800H with eight cores and 16 threads. NVIDIA’s ray-tracing-capable entry-level GeForce RTX 3050 Ti with a TGP of up to 75 watts (60 watts plus a maximum of 15 watts Dynamic Boost 2.0) is included as the discrete graphics card.

At 359.5 x 238 x 21.9 mm and less than 2 kg (XMG FOCUS 15) and 369.9 x 262 x 23.5 mm and 2.4 kg (XMG FOCUS 17), the laptops are slim and light for their size class. At the same time, they offer good memory expansion options: In addition to up to 64 GB DDR4-3200 RAM, they can hold an M.2 SSD connected via PCI Express 3.0 as well as a supplementary 2.5-inch SSD or HDD – a comparatively inexpensive solution for high storage volumes. The laptop chassis are characterised by a torsion-resistant base and a discreet, clearly structured design; avoiding excessive gaming elements. Only the LED backlighting of the full-format keyboard, with a key travel of 1.8 mm, separate numpad and large arrow keys, can be customised in 15 colours – if desired. The battery capacity is 49 Wh in each version.

XMG equips both with a 144 Hz IPS, Full HD resolution panel, featuring brightness of 300 nits and 90 percent sRGB colour space coverage. In the case of the XMG FOCUS 15, one-handed opening is possible.

On the connectivity side, the laptops provide three USB-A ports and one USB-C 3.2 Gen2 port. The latter does not integrate its own DisplayPort stream, instead the FOCUS 15 and FOCUS 17 each feature a Mini DisplayPort and an HDCP-capable HDMI output. Both are directly connected to the Intel Xe graphics unit of the Core i7-11800H via NVIDIA Optimus, allowing automatic deactivation of the dedicated NVIDIA graphics card in office or web operation, thus reducing energy consumption and extending battery run-time. The network connection is either wireless via Wi-Fi 6 or via a Gigabit Ethernet port. Furthermore, the laptops feature a headset-compatible headphone jack and an additional, separate microphone input, as well as a full-size SD card reader.

NVIDIA to launch GeForce RTX 40 in October
The manufacturer is now rumored to launch two product series in one year.



NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER “Ampere Refresh”
According to Greymon55 and RedGamingTech, NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER refresh is coming in early 2022. An announcement at CES 2022 is mentioned in the RGT video, but it isn’t quite clear if NVIDIA planning to launch mobile and desktop SUPER series at the same time. What is clear though is that there is a lot planned for CES 2022, including Intel’s Alder Lake mobile and possible Arc Alchemist announcement.

AMD is not in stagnation either. The company is expected to unveil its Ryzen 3D V-Cache-based series and mobile Rembrandt silicon. Clearly, there will be a lot happening in regard to the CPU and GPU market, with each company planning its own products, some of which have overlapping release dates, because they will be featured in the same products (laptops).


NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER refresh is now rumored to include GA103 GPU, a completely new Ampere processor that would give NVIDIA more options with configurations, especially for the mobile market. It may find its way to desktop series as well, but this has not been mentioned in any leak so far. The rumored RTX 3090 SUPER is more than likely to use GA102 GPU still, just with more cores and higher performance through optimizations.

NVIDIA RTX 40 “Lovelace”
More information on RTX 40 series, a successor to Ampere codenamed Lovelace is also being shared. Unlike AMD’s RDNA3, this architecture is not to use Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) design, but rather a monolithic approach. According to Greymon55, next-gen GPUs should now be expected in October 2022, but this claim does not refer only to NVIDIA Lovelace.


The RTX 30 SUPER refresh would arrive more than a year after the original series. This is already later than RTX 20 SUPER, which launched 11 months after the first Turing series. Since Ampere Refresh is expected 9 months before Lovelace’s announcement, NVIDIA is not expected to launch too many SUPER SKUs.

NVIDIA to launch GeForce RTX 40 in October
The manufacturer is now rumored to launch two product series in one year.



NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER “Ampere Refresh”
According to Greymon55 and RedGamingTech, NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER refresh is coming in early 2022. An announcement at CES 2022 is mentioned in the RGT video, but it isn’t quite clear if NVIDIA planning to launch mobile and desktop SUPER series at the same time. What is clear though is that there is a lot planned for CES 2022, including Intel’s Alder Lake mobile and possible Arc Alchemist announcement.

AMD is not in stagnation either. The company is expected to unveil its Ryzen 3D V-Cache-based series and mobile Rembrandt silicon. Clearly, there will be a lot happening in regard to the CPU and GPU market, with each company planning its own products, some of which have overlapping release dates, because they will be featured in the same products (laptops).


NVIDIA RTX 30 SUPER refresh is now rumored to include GA103 GPU, a completely new Ampere processor that would give NVIDIA more options with configurations, especially for the mobile market. It may find its way to desktop series as well, but this has not been mentioned in any leak so far. The rumored RTX 3090 SUPER is more than likely to use GA102 GPU still, just with more cores and higher performance through optimizations.

NVIDIA RTX 40 “Lovelace”
More information on RTX 40 series, a successor to Ampere codenamed Lovelace is also being shared. Unlike AMD’s RDNA3, this architecture is not to use Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) design, but rather a monolithic approach. According to Greymon55, next-gen GPUs should now be expected in October 2022, but this claim does not refer only to NVIDIA Lovelace.


The RTX 30 SUPER refresh would arrive more than a year after the original series. This is already later than RTX 20 SUPER, which launched 11 months after the first Turing series. Since Ampere Refresh is expected 9 months before Lovelace’s announcement, NVIDIA is not expected to launch too many SUPER SKUs.

n late August we received a set of photographs featuring a Gigabyte AORUS graphics card equipped with 20GB memory. The person that shared the photos with us did not provide any further details, which is why we were not sure if this card really did exist. As it turns out it does, but as far as we know such cards are only sold in St. Petersburg in Russia.



Gigabyte RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC 20GB, Source: КОЛЯ МАЙНЕР

Russian YouTuber КОЛЯ МАЙНЕР gained access to the card as soon as he learned where exactly they were available. From what is being said in the video that he made it appears that he had remote access to the card installed at the retailer’s warehouse.

The 20GB model of RTX 3080 Ti certainly does sound interesting to many enthusiasts, but unfortunately in this case the card only works in cryptomining. It lacks proper drivers (it is unsupported by the official Game Ready driver). The YouTuber actually tried to learn more about the card, such as finding drivers for this model, but Gigabyte Russia has responded that the company does not have such a model.

Interestingly the BIOS for this SKU  has already been shared through TechPowerUP GPU-Z software. It seems that there are at least three Gigabyte models out in the wild with 20GB memory: Gaming OC (which YouTuber tested), Aorus Xtreme, and Aorus Master. With the BIOS publicly available modders can now physically attach 20GB of memory to the card and use this BIOS to test it. Unforutnately this also means that the card won’t work in games, as this SKU lacks official support.



What is definitely interesting is the fact that this RTX 3080 Ti 20GB model is not equipped with LIte Hash Rate (LHR) algorithm. This means that the card was either manufactured before NVIDIA decided to put LHR on new Ti models, or that this model was supposed to launch later, but was eventually canceled. Yet, some cards magically still ended up at retailers and it wasn’t just packaging misprint.

The card was already preconfigured on-site by the retailers to operate at +100 MHz on the core and +1000 MHz on the memory while being power limited to 80% of its TDP. The YouTuber then tested the card with the various crypto algorithms. By far the most interesting results are from Ethereum mining using either Gminer or NBminer. In either software, the card offers 94 MH/s, nearly 64% higher than RTX 3080 Ti 12GB. The store actually provided a screenshot showing even 97.79 MH/s, but the YouTuber wasn’t able to achieve this (possibly because he was also streaming on the same PC).

The YouTuber revealed that the GAMING OC model which he tested was available at 225,000 rubles, which is 3,070 USD. This means that with the most profitable mining algorithm the card will pay off itself after more than 400 days.

We received photos confirming NVIDIA was originally planning to equip GeForce RTX 3080 Ti with 20GB memory.



Some of our readers may still remember that RTX 3080 Ti leaks have begun a long time ago. Nearly 8 months ago Gigabyte had submitted RTX 3080 Ti product codes to Eurasian Economic Commission, a South Korean standards conformity platform. Just 3 months later the same manufacturer filed more models featuring 12GB versions, which eventually became the final version.

As it turns out, some of the originally manufactured RTX 3080 Ti 20GB models might have reached distribution centers, at least their packaging might have. We received four photos from Alex, our reader from Russia, who found multiple RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards from Gigabyte. The cards are branded AORUS XTREME (GV-N308TAORUS X-20GD), which is the same product code that appeared in the first EEC leak.



The labels and stickers are located on both the packaging and the card itself, but it is unclear if the graphics card is physically equipped with 20GB of memory. Unfortunately, Alex has not responded to any of our emails after sharing the photos. Our belief is that Gigabyte simply reused already printed boxes for a late shipment, possibly as a mistake.

There are numerous animations produced and released all over the world every year. Here, anime, which is the Japanese term originating in Japan and especially means the animations made in Japan.

It is said that the first Japanese animation was made and released in 1917. Speaking of the earliest famous anime in Japan, Astro Boy (a.k.a. Mighty Atom) was released in 1963 as the first anime series aired on TV. Around hundreds of new anime are aired on TV and distributed to the movie streaming platforms and come to the screens every year, and the number of must-watch anime is going on increasing year by year.

The industry of anime has prospered substantially in Japan partly because the country has other Japanese pop cultures such as manga, video games and light novels. Some popular anime are adaptations of manga, video games, light novels and other media. And, anime has flourished worldwide so rapidly since anyone can access the Japanese animations with English dubs and subtitles.

Here are 30 best anime series including both the classic anime franchises and the brand new series. This greatest anime list will help beginners to find which anime to start watching with in the world or anime fans to decide the next one to try. Otherwise, check the best anime by anime freak’s standards.

This anime list focuses on TV anime series which Japanese call “anime”, so anime movies such as Studio Ghibli films or Makoto Shinkai’s animations are excluded.

It is not easy to narrow down to only 30 anime and rank them, and there are other attractive anime that are worth watching outside the best anime list, of course.

Let’s start a countdown!

Who decides what are the best anime series of all-time? Me? You? Or perhaps it’s a matter of personal taste. There’s so much to consider when putting together a list like this. Like, whether or not to place quality over fan favourites or if the most influential anime series deserves a special place at the top.

After receiving a considerable amount of love and hate for my 15 Most Powerful Anime Characters list, I figured I’d give a list of the Top 10 Best Anime Series of All-Time a go too.

Let’s dive in.

Top 10 Best Anime Series Of All-Time
Watching Anime Series
For many anime fans, they may have inadvertently started with the likes of Dragon Ball Z. The show was wildly popular throughout the ’90s. However, many of those viewers may not have gone on to become long-term fans of the genre. This, too, was almost my story. It wasn’t until over a decade later when I got back into anime through a series of circumstances. It quickly went from being a casual watcher to an avid fan.

After watching many of the best anime series, and rewatching some of my favourites, I’m fairly confident of providing my take on what I found to be my personal favourites. Even as I type that sentence, I realise that it wouldn’t be of the same opinion for many others, with each fan having their own personal favourites.

Anime, referring to animated productions made in Japan, is said to have first come about more than 100 years ago in 1917. But its popularity wasn’t as widespread until the 1960s when the first anime broadcast on television. This honour belongs to Astro Boy (a.k.a. Mighty Atom). Today, there are 100s of new anime series broadcast every year, only growing in popularity year-on-year.

The Top 10 Best Anime Series Of All-Time
I have a special relation to each of the series selected. Not only did they draw me in, each for their own reasons, but the art styles, voice acting, music and score, difficult themes and thought-provoking nature of many of them are what make them stand out to me. I could, and have, watched each of these shows more than once, with the second watching providing a lot more appreciation for each.

Looking for good anime to watch? We’ve got you.

Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World

Re:Zero starts off simple enough, but quickly turns into a series based on time loops, character development and unique villains. The adventure isn’t linear, and the time loops don’t always follow the expected path once reset.

The lead character, Subaru, is thrown into another world, Isekai, with his adventures kicking off after a chance encounter with the heroine, Emilia. It has quite a lot of comedic undertones, with Subaru, an anime fan, initially trying to predict all that will happen in his surroundings based on his experience watching anime. But things don’t turn out this way for him.

9
Death Note

After discovering a notebook capable of killing people when their names are written into it, the series revolves around a highly intelligent high school student, Light Yagami. Death Note is based on a manga of the same name, which ran between 2003 and 2006.

The show is popular largely in part thanks to its mystery and horror genre themes. It’s enjoyed by both Japanese and international audiences. The story is relatively short, spanning less than 40 episodes, making it concise and to the point without deviating too much, which can often happen with extended series.

8
Naruto

Naruto the anime series ran between 2002 and 2007, with Naruto: Shippuden airing between 2007 and 2017. The series is based on the Weekly Shonen Jump manga by Masashi Kishimoto released in 1999.

The series revolves around a fictional world of Shinobi, where Naruto learns to become a ninja master with the help of his friends and other masters. The Ninja techniques used in battles are derived from chakra energy.

Dealing with topics on strong bonds with friends and family, betrayal and overcoming various situations, the show is an intriguing adventure for the ages. The show is easy to get into, especially for newcomers and is widely regarded by many fans as a top anime deserving its spot on all top 10 lists and, for many, even at number one.

Naruto probably has one of the biggest anime fan bases across the genre.

7
Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai

Rurouni Kenshin is an anime based on a wandering swordsman who attempts to put his tormented past behind him. It takes place in Japan’s Meiji era with a glimpse into the life of people during that time. After stumbling upon a struggling martial arts school, he decides to help out, trying to live a simple life but turns out to be anything but.

The series takes on a wide range of topics, but there’s an underlying tone of remaining humble and giving of yourself to help those less fortunate and in need. There are numerous adventures in the series packed with great action with an anime style that pairs brilliantly. It’s just an all-round great story.

Rurouni Kenshin definitely deserves a place on everyone’s top 10 best anime series of all-time list.

6
Ghost in the Shell

In a not-too-distant future, Major Motoko Kusanagi, or simply just Major, and her group of officers as part of the Public Security Section 9 fight high crime around Japan. Ghost in the Shell is set in 2030, where science and technology have advanced allowing humans to become cyborgs with varying abilities to help humanity progress. However, Japanese syndicates have started to use these to their advantage.

Ghost in the Shell has inspired a generation of other anime, TV series and movies thanks to its concepts and art style, directed by Mamoru Oshii. While its live-action movie may not have received similar praise, it remains one of the best anime series of all time.

5
Steins;Gate

Steins;Gate is in the top 10 highest ranked anime series of all time across many of the rating platforms. This isn’t the only reason it deserves its spot on my list. Its sci-fi and time-travel themes are one of the best around, across TV and film. The show is takes place in Akihabara, Tokyo, which is a location for many fans to visit.

Rintaro Okabe, a university student, discovers time travel, and along with his fellow co-workers at Future Gadget Laboratory, must try to prevent an evil corporation from fulfilling their plans. There are a number of plot twists and surprise moments to keep you tuned in episode after episode.

4
Fullmetal Alchemist

The anime series is split into two series, Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The series is based on a manga series, which both shows follow fairly closely at the start. The former, however, proceeded to its end without the manga series having concluded, much the same as Game of Thrones. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is based on the entirety of the completed manga.

After an attempt to revive their deceased mother using alchemy, two brothers are badly inflicted when it goes horribly wrong. The older brother, Edward, loses his arm, while his younger brother, Alphonse, loses his entire body, and takes the form of metal armour to save him from death. Reviving someone from the dead is a huge taboo in the world of alchemy, with serious consequences, as the results prove. They set out in search of the Philosopher’s Stone in an attempt to right their wrongs.

But this is just the start of a wild adventure for the duo. As they leave their small home town, they’re thrusted into a world much bigger than them, having to overcome quite a lot of challenges and also to prevent an evil group from also finding the Philosopher’s Stone to achieve their goals.

3
Samurai Champloo

After a chance encounter, Fuu, a teenage waitress working in a teahouse, rescues two master swordsmen, Mugen and Jin, who have been arrested by the Japanese police after their battle inadvertently result in the death of a son of the local magistrate. At the time, the son was harassing Fuu, who saves the duo as a result of assisting her. She tasks the two to accompany her across Japan in pursuit of the Samurai who smells of sunflowers, and this is where the adventure really begins.

The show takes place in Edo-era Japan. What’s great about that is that Samurai Champloo attempts to be historically accurate with the time period, not just in the lifestyles, but also the events that take place, which the characters happen to be indirectly involved in.

It’s an easy-going anime series that’s funny and, at times, over-the-top. But its art style and comedic elements makes it an easy watch for first time anime watchers.

Samurai Champloo is also only one of three anime shows my fiancé has indevoured to watch through its entirety. The hip-hop music themes are also relatable, bring a unique style along with it, to accompany the great sword battles throughout the series.

2
Darker Than Black

A decade ago, a mysterious anomaly known as Heaven’s Gate appeared over the majority of South America. Soon after, another of these appeared in Tokyo, known as Hell’s Gate, which altered the sky and wreaking havoc on the surrounding area. As a result of this, the stars in the sky disappeared, replaced with fake stars. Each of these fake stars are linked to people who possess special abilities, known as Contractors.

These Contractors have been found and trained by various governments to utilise as spies and assassins. However, whenever they use their abilities, they have to “pay the price”, which comes in various forms, eating excessively, do self-harm, change their bodies and the likes. The powers come at the cost of their humanity, murdering through objectives and rationale, suppressing any emotional and other human hinderances to stop them from achieving their goals.

Darker Than Black is one of my all-time favourite anime series. It’s highly rated by many, but doesn’t often appear on many lists, unfortunately. I love the show, and requires at least two series watches to appreciate all the details and meaning extracted from the show. It may be a relatively short span of episodes, but isn’t an easy watch, especially for any new anime fans. Despite Contractor’s lack of humanity, Hei, the lead character, is a slight contradiction of this, battling against other Contractors through a group known as the Syndicate.

1
Attack on Titan

Attack on Titan is the only series on the list that is still ongoing. The series is based on a manga released in 2009 with the first episode airing in 2013. After eight years, the show is in its final season, due to end within the next month or so. The story starts off on the Paradis Island, where its inhabitants have built huge walls to protect themselves from attacks from mindless titans.

Things quickly take a turn for the worse when two titans break through the walls, sparking a war that spans almost 13 years from the start of the series. Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman join the Survey Corps as they seek revenge on the titans after destroying their home and eating Eren’s mother. But what starts off as a simple battle against titans, there is a lot to uncover beyond the walls. Having initially thought of themselves as the last humans, there’s even more to discover further across the oceans.

Even beyond the show, there is a lot to unpack. There’s rich lore that has the potential to be explored beyond the show’s episodes, with just as many questions. The plot twists are crazy with bombshells at almost every turn. The voice actors do a great job for both the Japanese and English dubs, making the emotional connection what brings me back for more.

Having watched the series again a second time around, there’s far more to understand. You realise that each action has a consequence on the history of the war, dating back to many generations before Eren and Mikasa are involved. Even with the show coming to its conclusion soon, with quite a lot of lore to still unpack, one can only hope for a prequel series to bring fans back for more.

Saitama - One Punch Man
But wait. There’s more.

How can we forget these shows?

Honourabl Mentions:
I could have easily ended the post with the list of 10. But it may not be fair to some other great anime series. These are great in their own right, but just didn’t make the cut for my list.

One Piece
The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, along with his pirate crew. They attempt to find the greatest treasure, left by the legendary pirate, Gold Roger. The show’s title is derived from this treasure, known as “One Piece.”

The show is beloved by many, and for most fans deserves its spot in the top 10. This is true, and fully agree. But personally, it doesn’t match the connection and personal preference from the shows on my list. Where it loses me, most is the continued run, still running after two decades. That shows its staying power, but where it loses me.

Erased
Having been sent back in time some 18 years, 29-year-old Satoru attempts to prevent his mom’s death in his teens, a story which began after a series of kidnappings when he was in the 5th grade.

The show is a slow grind, but worth it. The premise may not be real, but the struggles and emotion displayed by Satoru is very realistic, dealing with themes about society and real-world struggles.

Cowboy Bebop
Cowboy Bebop is a story about Spike Spiegel, a futuristic bounty hunter with a laid-back lifestyle, despite his deadly skills in martial arts. Alongside his partners, Jet Black and Faye Valentine (later in the series), they roam across the galaxy in search of high-priced bounty for fugitives.

The show has an authenticity about it, despite its futuristic themes. The realism is what draws you in and keeps you entertained with action, comedy and a killer score to round things off.

Ergo Proxy
The story is viewed through the lens of a post-apocalyptic future. Here, humans live in peace with AI-powered androids. But things quickly take a turn for the lead, inspector Re-L, after a series of murders, which cause tensions and threaten to dismantle the state of peace.

The story is vivid and feels too real. With quite a lot of focus on philosophical and moral questions we face in the real world, the show deserves to be watched at least twice to grasp all the nuances and concepts it brings to the fore.

One Punch Man
One Punch Man is a relatively new series, compared to others on the list. With only two seasons having been released, spaced across four years between them, it continues to leave fans wanting more.

The series revolves around a seemingly oblivious hero, Saitama, who does it just for the fun of it. As the title suggests, he is able to defeat his enemies with a single punch.

Dragon Ball Z
A young warrior named Goku, along with his friends, are tasked with defending their planet from an onslaught of attacks from extraterrestrial enemies. But things aren’t as straight forward as it is on paper, with Goku learning that he, too, is from another planet, and a crazy number of twists through the show’s ’90s run.

Most kids growing up in the ’90s would have watched or come across Dragon Ball Z. In South Africa, the was a huge hit, as I recall all my friends rushing home between 4pm and 5pm when the show aired. Whether we were in the middle of a game of football or cricket, the streets would clear. This was the impact of the show, which many still remember fondly today.

And there you have it.

That’s my list of the top 10 best anime series of all-time. I can imagine that at least five of these shows would be on many lists, with quite a few being challenged.

But what are your thoughts? What is your top 10 best anime series of all-time?

The best graphics cards in 2021

The best graphics cards are slowly coming back in stock.

The best graphics card wont suddenly be inundating storefronts any time soon, but it's no longer as much of a struggle to buy a new GPU as it was a few months ago. And GPUs are getting cheaper, though they still take their toll on our wallets more than we'd like. Supply and demand economics be damned! We do have some tips as to how to buy a graphics card during these tough times, if you're still having trouble.

While there have been some Covid-19 related supply chain issues (and cryptocurrency mining booms) making it difficult to buy a GPU recently, we've still managed to test every new graphics card of the most recent generation. Putting them through the gaming benchmark wringer on our PCG test bench, we've seen how they compare in thermal performance tests, power draw measurements with dedicated tools, and even average frequencies and frame times.

What we've discovered? The GPU scene is finally getting competitive again. The launch of the Radeon RX 6600 XT made things very interesting, with Nvidia and AMD both now clambering for the top spot. Next year, Intel will even be offering a third way: The Intel Alchemist graphics card.

Nvidia's Ampere generation has impressed so far. The GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 are two of the best graphics cards to date, with AMD nipping at their heels with the Radeon RX 6800 XT rivalling some of the RTX 3080's stellar graphical performance at the high end. And yes, 4K gaming is very much in the PC's wheelhouse now.

REASONS TO BUY
+Incredible gen-on-gen performance
+Makes 2080 Ti look mid-range
+Ray tracing no longer a sacrifice
REASONS TO AVOID
-Needs a beefy PSU
-In high demand
Okay, right now, the RTX 3080 is rare as pigeon eyelashes, but there is no doubt Nvidia's new RTX 3080 is the best graphics card today. It represents a huge generational performance boost over the previous RTX 20-series. That's impressive when put up against either the RTX 2080 or 2080 Super, but when you consider that this nominally $699 card can not just match but massively outperform the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti, it really hits home.

The thing which really stands out from our testing is the difference it makes to ray-tracing performance. The first generation of ray tracing-capable cards required such a huge frame rate sacrifice that most people shied away from turning it on, but that's no longer the case with this generation.

When you can now get ray-traced performance that exceeds the frame rates you'd get out of the top card of the RTX 20-series when running without it, you know that this is a whole different beast. And hey, the RTX 3080 can actually run Crysis.

Nvidia has managed this by adding a whole load more CUDA cores to the mix in this 8nm GPU and updated Tensor Cores (for extra DLSS goodness) and second-gen RT Cores to make with the ray-traced pretties.

The RTX 3080 may need a fair chunk more power—you'll want at least an 850W PSU—and be tricky to get hold of, but this is the most desirable graphics card around today. Which I guess is also why it's so tricky to get hold of.

REASONS TO BUY
+4K excellence
+Cheaper than an RTX 3080
REASONS TO AVOID
-Moderate ray tracing performance
-Slower than the 3080 at 4K
As a red team alternative to Nvidia's high-end graphics cards, there have been few finer than the RX 6800 XT. A highly competitive card that comes so close to its rival, with a nominal performance differential to the RTX 3080, is truly an enthusiast card worth consideration for any PC gamer with 4K in their sights.

It's a tough call between it and the RTX 3080, but the latter pips AMD to the post with the final touches à la RTX. The RX 6800 XT is $50 cheaper, delivers high 4K performance and a hefty VRAM increase over the RTX 3080. However, it's easy to argue that an extra $50 dropped on the RTX 3080 is money well spent: a small price to pay for greater 4K performance, much-improved ray tracing, and DLSS. All are available today and with two year's worth of developer support in the bank.

Yet we're still big fans of what AMD has managed to accomplish with the RX 6800 XT, a return to form for the Radeon Technology Group that injects some much-needed competition into the GPU market and offers a worthy red team alternative for any high-end gaming PC build.

+Finally! Something a little more affordable
+2080 Super performance
+Under $400
REASONS TO AVOID
-Annoying 12-pin power connector
-Not quite good enough for 4K
The best value Ampere to date, the RTX 3060 Ti, is very closely related to the RTX 3070. Both utilize the same GA104 GPU (the RTX 3060 Ti has fewer SMs enabled), with the same 8GB of GDDR6 memory across a 256-bit bus.

While 17% less capable in core count, the RTX 3060 Ti makes up for it with some judicious GPU Boost frequencies. That partially explains why the RTX 3060 Ti can be within 17% to just single digits off the pace of the RTX 3070, despite operating at a silicon disadvantage. Not bad for a $399 card.

If you haven't already done the maths: At $399, the RTX 3060 Ti is 20% cheaper than the RTX 3070, so performance per dollar is on the up with the diminutive graphics card. That's why we love it so; it's a great GPU for the full stack of resolutions and has decent ray tracing capability to boot, courtesy of second-generation RT Cores.

If the RTX 3080 or RTX 3070 seem out of reach, the RTX 3060 Ti certainly makes for a decent stand-in. Perhaps most impressive of this graphics card is how it stacks up to the 20-series generation: It topples the RTX 2080 Super in nearly every test.

Perhaps the only high-end Ampere that's anything close to reasonably affordable, the RTX 3070 is also impressive for its ability to match the top-string Turing graphics card, the RTX 2080 Ti, for less than half of its price tag.

At $499, it's still a significant sum by any means—we're talking next-gen console equivalent pricing here—but it's hardly an exorbitant sum when compared to PC gaming's top graphics silicon today. In return, you're gifted a 4K-capable graphics card that doesn't require too much fiddling to reach playable, if not high, framerates. And it'll absolutely smash it at 1440p, no question about that.

Its gaming performance credentials are undoubtedly impressive, but what makes the RTX 3070 our pick for the sensible PC gaming connoisseur is the entire Nvidia ecosystem underlying the RTX stack today. DLSS is a neat trick for improving performance, with only a nominal loss in clarity, and other features such as Broadcast and Reflex go a long way to sweetening the deal.

+Occasional RTX 3090 performance…
+...but cheaper!
REASONS TO AVOID
-Can lag behind RTX 3080 at times
-Mediocre ray-tracing performance
The RTX 3090 may have sat unchallenged at the top rungs of graphics performance at launch, but it wouldn't be long until AMD rustled together a challenger in the RX 6900 XT, or 'Big Navi.' The RX 6900 XT hopes to knock Ampere's finest from its perch on high and send it spiraling back down to Earth. And it gets kind of close, too, with 4K performance a little off the pace of the RTX 3090—and all for one-third off the asking price.

For that reason, it's simply the better buy for any PC gamer without any ulterior motives of the pro-creator variety. But there's a reason it's not number one in our graphics card guide today, and that's simply due to the fact it's not that much better than an RTX 3080, and sometimes not at all. It's another $300 on top of the RTX 3080's price tag, and you'd hope for higher performance in both rasterized and ray tracing workloads. Yet, inevitably its ray-tracing acceleration lags behind the competition.

But the RX 6900 XT does come with assurances that the RTX 3080 can't make, such as its 16GB of GDDR6 memory, which is a whole 6GB greater than the 10GB of (faster) GDDR6X memory on the green team card. With that in mind, for raw gaming alone, the RX 6900 XT is a cheaper alternative to the RTX 3090 is still a victim to its own extreme price tag.

REASONS TO AVOID
-Not really for gamers
-RTX 3080 isn't far behind
This colossal graphics card is supremely powerful but far more fitting of Titan credentials than GeForce ones. It's not built with your average gamer in mind. Instead, it's targeting creative professionals and compute-intensive application acceleration, and that's why it doesn't come with your average price tag, either.

As immense in price tag as it is in stature, the question on everyone's lips is: Is it worth it? For gamers, no. It's just not much quicker than the RTX 3080. But for pro-creators, for whom time is money and where lower render time has a direct correlation with how much they can earn, that's where the RTX 3090 comes into its own.

It's for that reason that we've placed this card near the bottom of our list, but since we know PC gamers will undoubtedly spend ungodly quantities of cash to save face and ensure bragging rights, it's still worth a mention. After all, it is the most powerful gaming graphics card on the planet right now, whether it's a great deal or not.

+Stellar 1440p card
+Often outperforms cheaper RTX 3070
REASONS TO AVOID
-Doesn't compare well to the RTX 3070
-Unexciting ray-tracing performance
As the only one of the AMD RX 6000-series cards to launch without undercutting a direct Nvidia Ampere rival, the straight RX 6800 feels as though it's almost been cut adrift. It's a strange situation because historically, we've always been keen to recommend the second string of any Radeon release. AMD tends to launch main series cards in pairs, one with the full might of the new GPU and a secondary card with a slightly stripped back chip.

Normally they perform at a similar level for a lot less cash. Except for this time, the performance gap is relatively large, and the price difference is not great enough to negate the issue. You've also got the RTX 3070 is priced $80 lower than this RX 6800 card. Sure, the RX 6800 does sometimes outperform the cheaper Nvidia card, but for the money, you'd surely want the only marginally more expensive RX 6800 XT because it's much faster. If I spent this much cash on a new GPU, the extra $70 would absolutely feel worth it.

The RTX 3070 also offers Nvidia's broad gaming ecosystem and, while ray tracing can be seen as a luxury, DLSS is an excellent performance-boosting feature still not matched by AMD. But it does have to be said; the RX 6800 is still a mighty impressive card outside of the ramifications of its place in the stack. This thing makes the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti look bad.

Graphics cards buying advice
Top down shot of an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card without a cooler on so you can see the GPU itself

How can I buy a graphics card in the GPU drought?
You could attempt to manually refresh every store page in the hopes of striking gold on the next restock; that's one way to go about it. Or, you could sign up for a trusty app that goes about trawling major retailers for you. It's not a bot that tries to snap up stock the wrong way; it just does the refreshing, so you don't have to.

We've had success with the app HotStock in the UK, and sites such as Stock Informer offer a similar service in the US, although we've not used this service to score stock personally.

Similarly, you can find plenty of free Discord servers with dedicated stock alert bots and eagle-eyed community members, such as the popular StockDrops server. 

And don't forget Twitch streams. Those dedicated to finding your stock will often fire out a deafening klaxon the moment stock appears. We recommend checking out Falcodrin on Twitch for Nvidia GPUs, but there are plenty of kind souls out there offering a similar service.

Is there an easy way to get a new graphics card?
It's not for everyone, but the best way to ensure you'll receive a graphics card this year, and a modern one at something close to MSRP, is to buy a prebuilt gaming PC. It's a worthy consideration if you're considering a total rebuild at some point in the future, at least. System builders appear to enjoy a more stable supply of graphics cards, and while some still expect delays, you are at least guaranteed a PC with GPU in situ eventually.

Is GTX better than RTX?
The older GTX prefix is now used to denote older Nvidia graphics cards which don't have the extra AI and ray tracing silicon that the RTX-level cards do. This RTX prefix was introduced three years ago with the RTX 20-series, and highlights which cards have GPUs which sport both the Tensor Cores and RT Cores necessary for real-time ray tracing and Deep Learning Super Sampling.

Is ray tracing only for RTX cards?
The RTX prefix is only used to denote cards which house Nvidia GPUs with dedicated ray tracing hardware, but they are still using the same DirectX Raytracing API Microsoft has created, and which is used by AMD's RDNA 2 GPUs. These AMD GPUs are able to suport real-time ray tracing, though with a higher performance impact than on Nvidia's GPUs.

Intel's upcoming Xe-HPG GPUs, with the Alchemist graphics cards first to use them, will also support ray tracing using Microsoft's DirectX Raytracing API when they launch early next year, too.

Is SLI or CrossFire still a thing?
If you're looking for maximum performance, you used to run two cards in SLI or CrossFire. However, it's become increasingly common for major games to ignore multi-GPU users completely. That includes all DXR games. There's also the fact that fewer of the next-gen cards actually support the linking of two cards. On the Nvidia side, only the $1,500 RTX 3090 comes with NVLink connections, only for creative apps.

So, no. It's not a thing.

Do I need a 4K capable graphics card?
The obvious answer is: Only if you have a 4K gaming monitor. But there are other things to consider here, such as what kinds of games do you play? If frame rates are absolutely king for you, and you're into ultra-competitive shooters, then you want to be aiming for super high fps figures. And, right now, you're better placed to do that at either 1440p or 1080p resolutions.

That said, the more games, such as CoD: Warzone that incorporates DLSS, the more Nvidia cards will be capable of making a close approximation of 4K visuals on your 4K monitor, but at higher frame rates.

What's a Founders Edition graphics card?
The Founders Edition cards are simply Nvidia's in-house designs for its graphics cards, as opposed to those designed by its partners. These are usually reference cards, meaning they run at stock clocks. 

Briefly, for the RTX 20-series, Nvidia decided to offer Founders Editions with factory overclocks. These had made it a little difficult to compare cards, as Founders Edition cards give us a baseline for performance, but Nvidia has since returned to producing them as reference again.
